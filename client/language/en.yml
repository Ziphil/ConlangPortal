    There are duplicate language family codes.
    You can proceed with the application, but the language family you are applying for must be identical with those with the same code that already exist.
    If you are not sure, please change the language family code to another one.

    explanation: >-
      The language family code is used to group multiple languages that are being created by an individual or group.
      For example, if you are creating multiple languages that are spoken within a single imaginary world or categorised into a single language family, then that imaginary world or language family will be the “group” here.
      Enter a code to identify such a group.
      If there is no need for grouping, as in the case where you have created only one language, check the “Do not specify” checkbox.

      The purpose of this site is to serve as a web portal of constructed languages by collecting information about them through the issuance and maintenance of unique codes (CLA codes) that identify artificial languages around the world.
      Conlang creators can submit a request to obtain a code from this site, and can post various information about their languages along with the code.
  aboutCode:
    head: "About CLA codes"
    content: >-
      CLA codes are designed to be uniquely assigned to constructed languages around the world.
      You can think of it as a conlang version of ISO 639, which assigns a unique code to every natural language in the world, as defined by the International Organization for Standardization.
      ---
      CLA codes have a four-level hierarchy: creator, language family, language and dialect.
      The following is a brief explanation of the role of each hierarchy.
      ---
      The creator code consists of three lowercase Latin letters, and indicates the creator or creation group of the language.
      ---
      The language family code consists of three lowercase Latin letters, and is used to group languages created by the same creator or creation group.
      For example, if you have several languages designed to be spoken in the same fictional world, that fictional world is the “language family” here.
      If you do not need a specific grouping, you can choose not to specify a language family code.
      ---
      The language code consists of two lowercase Latin letters, representing each constructed language.
      ---
      The dialect code consists of two lowercase Latin letters, and is used to identify each dialect if the language has more than one dialect setting.
      If your language does not have a dialect, you can choose not to specify a dialect code.
